                <h3>DevOps Engineer - Republic Services, Phoenix, AZ</h3>
                <h4>(July 2022 - Present)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    I am responsible for monthly code releases to production. This entails verifying and applying terraform plans on all
                    application workspaces on terraform cloud, running bash shell scripts to trigger code deployment on GitHub Actions to
                    AWS cloud platform for applications leveraging the ECS and Lambda services.</li>
                    <li>I perform routine code deployments to lower environments on AWS cloud e.g., Dev, QA, UAT, STG and other
                    production-like environments to facilitate regression testing by the QA teams. I perform these deployments in the same
                    manner as production deployments but without change requests.</li>
                    <li>I am part of a multi-national ‘Operations and Maintenance’ team with members in various locations in the US and India
                    that monitored performance of applications in both production and non-production environments. I am responsible for
                    responding to AWS CloudWatch and Splunk alerts, monitoring AWS cloud resources and responding to incidences following
                    major incidence response protocols.</li>
                    <li>I maintain application infrastructure composed of various cloud resources using Terraform - infrastructure as code. I
                    maintain environment-agnostic reusable terraform modules with configurations for common resources such as IAM roles,
                    Security Groups, Relational Databases, DynamoDB tables etc. and used Terraform cloud to manage Terraform plans and
                    deploy infrastructure to AWS cloud.</li>
                    <li>I have contributed to efforts to automate various DevOps tasks to ensure efficiency and consistency. Utilizing bash
                    shell scripting, I automated the process of fetching the latest release candidate tags from release branches on
                    application repositories on GitHub and triggering the deployment of 17 different applications concurrently on GitHub
                    Actions at the click of a button. I also scripted other tasks such as taking RDS snapshots and backups of DynamoDB
                    tables on AWS utilizing AWS CLI commands, managing workspace settings on Terraform cloud workspaces, creating branches,
                    editing, staging, and committing code and creating pull requests where the code fits into a repeated pattern using bash
                    and utilizing GitHub CLI commands.</li>
                    <li>I manage CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions. I rely on actions available on the marketplace as well as write custom
                    actions and reusable workflows for various tasks e.g., deploying applications, creating, and publishing artifacts,
                    validating various pre-deployment conditions. I have also written the actual workflows that call these actions and
                    reusable workflows.</li>
                    <li>I am a collaborative member of the DevOps Sprint team, I participate in daily standup meeting, contribute to ideas and
                    discussions on how to tackle ongoing tasks, I utilize Confluence for documentation and Rally board for tracking tasks
                    i.e., user stories and defects, I perform pull request reviews, and maintain cross-team communication on Microsoft teams
                    to ensure the team meets it’s sprint objectives.</li>
